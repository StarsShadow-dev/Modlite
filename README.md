# Modlite

A work in progress programming language.

A work in progress VS code extension is [here](https://github.com/StarsShadow-dev/modlite-vscode-extension).

## This programming language is currently in an experimental phase
This means that:
- some features may not be working
- the syntax may change drastically with later visions
- and due to frequent syntax changes there is no documentation
	- if you want to try to use the language you can find examples [here](./tests)
